## What do?

Add all the players who are playing, pass the device to the first player on the list, once they hit begin then the timer will start. Two phrases will be shown on the screen, one in English-like Cantonese and one in English. The player must then speak the Engish-like phrase, and the other players must guess what the real English phrase is. If they get it right, they get a point, if not, then no points are awarded. Once the timer runs out, the next player will be given the device and the process will repeat until all players have had a turn.

> You aren't allowed to speak the English phrase or subsections of it, you can only speak the English-like Cantonese phrase. You can however use gestures, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues to help convey the meaning.
